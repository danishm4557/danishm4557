- 👋 Hi, I’m Danish.
- 👀 I’m a full-stack software engineer at [Bridge's Shop Local E-commerce Platform](https://www.shoplocal.org). I help connect big brands with local retailers and distributors to promote shopping locally. By shopping locally, we can redirect our sales tax back into improving our own communities.
- 👨‍💻 Coding is my passion and I love to bring my creativity to life outside of work too. Please react out if you would like to collaborate on a project.
