- 👋 Hi, I’m Danish.
- 👀 I’m a full-stack software engineer at <a href="shoplocal.org" target="_blank">Bridge's Shop Local E-commerce Platform</a>. I connect big brands with local retailers and distributors to promote shopping locally. By shopping locally, we can redirect our sales tax back into improving our own communities.
- 💞️ I love to work on personal coding and DIY projects outside of work. I would love to collaborate on projects and build new connections.
